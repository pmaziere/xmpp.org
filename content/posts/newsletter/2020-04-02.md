Lets say it like this: Removing OTR + Rework conference and contact details + show PDF previews + title for audio files = [Pix-Art Messenger 2.3.5](https://github.com/kriztan/Pix-Art-Messenger/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

Four letters for Windows Users: [UWPX 0.25.0](https://github.com/UWPX/UWPX-Client/releases/tag/v.0.25.0.0) is online with Windows10X support (what ever that Windows 10 is) and a push server. So give it a try!

### Servers




### Clients and applications

The maintainer of libstrophe, [Pasis](https://github.com/pasis), and contributor to Profanity, created a tool called [xmppconsole](https://github.com/pasis/xmppconsole) which sends raw XMPP stanzas over an XMPP connection and displays the XMPP stream. Main purpose is to study XEPs and debug servers implementation.
The tool is under development, the finished version will support both GTK UI and ncurses UI. In the blog they also explained how to easier contribute commits to their repository, [read on](https://profanity-im.github.io/blog/post/contributing-a-patch-via-github/)!
