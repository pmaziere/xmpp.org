## Intro

Welcome to the XMPP newsletter covering the month of February and March 2020.

We had a big delay releasing and finalizing the February release of the XMPP Newsletter. So the decision was made to combine both into this version - apologies! 

Help us sustain this as a community effort, which [process is fully documented](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/News_and_Articles_for_the_next_XMPP_Newsletter).

Anyway, we are always happy to contributors - just come along and talk to us in the [Comm-Team MUC](xmpp:commteam@muc.xmpp.org?join) and thereby help us sustain this as a community effort, which [process is fully documented](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/News_and_Articles_for_the_next_XMPP_Newsletter).

## Articles

A nice and short summary about XMPP - [en español](https://www.altaruru.com/que-es-xmpp/)!

Marvin Schirrmacher [analysed WhatsApp's VoIP protocol](https://medium.com/@schirrmacher/analyzing-whatsapp-calls-176a9e776213). He extracted cryptographic keys and also showed that code obscurity does not finally protect against attackers. Further readings on GitHub [here](https://github.com/schirrmacher/files/blob/master/WhatsApp%20VoIP%20Protocol.pdf), [https://github.com/schirrmacher/files/blob/master/WhatsApp here](https://github.com/schirrmacher/files/blob/master/WhatsApp) and [https://github.com/schirrmacher/files/blob/master/WhatsAppCore here](https://github.com/schirrmacher/files/blob/master/WhatsAppCore).

[Mobile Kommunikation: zeitgemäß und rechtskonform](https://www.behoerden-spiegel.de/2020/02/12/mobile-kommunikation-zeitgemaess-und-rechtskonform/) German article about mobile communication in authorities mentioning MOKA/XMPP.

Daniel Gultsch (iNPUTmice) [published several posts](http://nitter.net/iNPUTmice/status/1228950491805167617#m) commenting on the situation on OMEMO initial vectors.

A discussion (Spanish) on Quey compared the [performance of XMPP and Matrix](https://quey.org/@GatoOscuro/103685251805747041). Seems that XMPP outperforms easily!

Liz Flynn scheduled a [notification for IETF-107](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/mls/history/) for Messaging Layer Security (MLS). You can read the current architecture draft [here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mls-architecture/).

After a recent [secruity flaw in WhatsApp groups](https://www.dw.com/en/whatsapp-security-flaw-over-60000-groups-still-accessible-online/a-52543414), the FSFE recommends XMPP as [decentral and open alternative amd solution](https://fsfe.org/news/2020/news-20200228-01.en.html). The XSF tweeted about this already.

debxwoody has started to build a [place for German users of XMPP](https://xmpp-messenger.de/index.html) including social media, mailing list, homepage and a blog. He is calling for supporters!

After the Prosody team [released Snikket](https://blog.prosody.im/introducing-snikket/), Alexander Gnauck explains how to run it on your [NAS](https://www.ag-software.net/2020/02/28/run-snikket-on-your-nas/). 

Sam Whited wrote about the [Go XMPP library](https://blog.samwhited.com/2020/02/extensions-in-mellium/).

Turns out [Grindr uses #XMPP for their in-app chat](https://mastodon.xyz/@jcbrand/103757814572529323)

emus created a blog post from his brainstorming and talk on a vision for XMPP he created during the Berlin "Online" Sprint.

## Events

After the work from Düsseldorf sprint [OMEMO has been released to version 0.4](https://github.com/xsf/xeps/pull/903 XEP-0384) - Congratulations to the authors! Further readings of their notes on [NEWMEMO](https://hackmd.syndace.com/s/r1fNElZSL) and [OMEMO:1 Requirement](https://hackmd.syndace.com/jG00qKF0SUy_AKUlXJcblQ#). Paul Schaub luckily alo could not refuse to again published his summary: [OMEMO Specification Sprint](https://blog.jabberhead.tk/2020/03/10/omemo-specification-sprint/).

On 1-2 February, [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2020/), was held in Brussels, Belgium. As usual the XMPP community coordinated the Real-Time Lounge, a corner where several open source projects around Real Time Communication can present themselves. At the XMPP booth there were lots of nice conversations with FOSDEM visitors. The easy onboarding of Snikket was one of the eye catchers at the booth. In the Real Time developers room thee was a talk about the [modularity of the XMPP protocol](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/xmpp/) by Winfried Tilanus.

As usual, before FOSDEM a part of the XMPP community gathered for [XMPP summit 24](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Conferences/Summit_24). Over the course of two days many aspects of the XMPP protocol were discussed, including onboarding, 'rich presence', several aspects of encryption, MIX, Bind/SASL, Stickers and rich markup. The attendants regarded this summit as very productive and many of the discussions already resulted in proposed protocol extensions and patches to existing extensions.

The Berlin "Online" Sprint is over! No chance for COV-ID19 - it was a non-voluntary situation, but great experience and impressively many people attended. Tim Schrock from the DBJR published a [short summary of our virtual sprint](https://www.dbjr.de/en/article/entwicklerinnentreffen-zu-freier-kommunikation/).

## Extensions and specifications

With respect to the last month we mention what happened in February as well to ensure completeness. So due to the late publishing this is is likely already over yet. Therefore, please remind the specified dates for Last Call and Call for Experience.

### Deferred

- XEP-0386 (Bind 2.0)

### Updated

- Version 0.3.1 of XEP-0343 (Signaling WebRTC datachannels in Jingle) has been released.
Abstract: This specification defines how to use the ICE-UDP Jingle transport
method to send media data using WebRTC DataChannels, so technically
uses DTLS/SCTP on top of the Interactive Connectivity Establishment
(ICE) methodology, which provides robust NAT traversal for media
traffic.
URL: https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0343.html

- Version 0.4.0 of XEP-0384 (OMEMO Encryption) has been released.
Abstract: This specification defines a protocol for end-to-end encryption in
one-to-one chats, as well as group chats where each participant may
have multiple clients per account.
URL: https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html

- Version 1.1.2 of XEP-0167 (Jingle RTP Sessions) has been released.
Abstract: This specification defines a Jingle application type for negotiating
one or more sessions that use the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP)
to exchange media such as voice or video. The application type
includes a straightforward mapping to Session Description Protocol
(SDP) for interworking with SIP media endpoints.
URL: https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0167.html

### Last Call

- This message constitutes notice of a Last Call for comments on
XEP-0398.
Title: User Avatar to vCard-Based Avatars Conversion
Abstract: This specification describes a method for using PEP based avatars and
vCard based avatars in parallel by having the user’s server do a
conversion between the two.
URL: https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0398.html
This Last Call begins today and shall end at the close of business on
2020-02-26.

- This message constitutes notice of a Last Call for comments on
XEP-0402.
Title: PEP Native Bookmarks
Abstract: This specification defines a syntax and storage profile for keeping a
list of chatroom bookmarks on the server.
URL: https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0402.html
This Last Call begins today and shall end at the close of business on
2020-03-03.

### Miscellaneous

**ProtoXEP**

The XMPP Extensions Editor has received a proposal for a new XEP.

- Title: Simple JSON Messaging
Abstract: This specification proposes a simple mechanism by which applications
can transfer data safely, without needing additional protocol design
work. It is intended to provide a protocol that is trivial to
implement and can be driven with a simple API.
URL: https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/udt.html

- Title: Extended Channel Search
Abstract: This specification provides a standardised protocol to search for
public group chats. In contrast to XEP-0030 (Service Discovery), it
works across multiple domains and in contrast to XEP-0055 (Jabber
Search) it more clearly handles extensibility.
URL: https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/extended-channel-search.html

- Title: Trust Messages
Abstract: This document specifies a way to communicate the trust in public long-
term keys used by end-to-end encryption protocols from one endpoint to
another.
URL: https://xmpp.org/extensions/inbox/trust-messages.html

The Council will decide in the next two weeks whether to accept this
proposal as an official XEP.

**Experimental**

Version 0.1.0 of XEP-0434 (Trust Messages) has been released.
Abstract: This document specifies a way to communicate the trust in public long-
term keys used by end-to-end encryption protocols from one endpoint to
another.
Changelog: Accepted by vote of Council on 2020-02-19. (XEP Editor (jsc))
URL: https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0434.html

**Active**

- Version 1.0.0 of XEP-0345 (Form of Membership Applications) has been
released.
Abstract: This specification outlines the form and mandatory content of
